* introduction

Iota² is a processing chain developed by the [[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr][CESBIO]] : [Centre d'Etude Spatiales de la BIOshphère] which produces a land cover image
like this one.[mettre un lien]

Every datas you need are resumed into the "What you need" section.
Before launching the chain it is necessary to declare, thanks to a configuration file, where and how are stored datas. 
It is this configuration file which rules all the test. All parameters of this file are detailed inside the "How to configure Iota" section. 
When inputs are ready, you can launch the chain as described in the next section : "How to launch Iota²". Once the chain is terminated, it produce
a series of folders, and results as describe into the "Products" section.

* What you need

You need to get OTB 5.0 or greater and some other python packages:
- argparse
- gdal,ogr
- config
- os
- glob
- shutil
- osgeo
- datetime
- collections
- numpy
- time
- scipy
- osr
- random
- matplotlib
- cPickle
- subprocess
- math
- re
- unittest
- filecmp
- gdal

as already mentioned, you also need to fill out a configuration file.

* How to configure Iota²

Currently a configuration file is divided in four parts: Chain, learning, classification, and features. All parts contain fields described below.
Some parameters are directly linked to OTB functions, so for these parameters please refer to [[https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/documentation/][OTB cookbook]]

** Chain

This part corresponds to the general description of the test.

(1) Example of file describing nomenclature

$ cat Nomenclature.csv

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
summer:11
winter:12
corn:44
town:41
#+END_EXAMPLE

/!\ no empty line.

(2) Description of the different models repartition mode  

 - multi_regions mode :
             many models will be learned for the classification. Tiles use in order to build a model are described into the file informed by the field 'model'. 
 - one_region mode : 
             means that only one model will be build for the classification. All tiles in 'listTiles' will be used to learn that model.
 - outside mode : 
             in this mode, the regions shape is provided by the user.

(3) Example of a file which link tiles and their belonging model

$ cat modelDescription.txt

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
r1 : D0001H0002,D0001H0003
r2 : D0002H0003
r3 : D0002H0002,D0002H0003,D0002H0001
#+END_EXAMPLE

This example means three models, the first model is built using two tiles : D0001H0002,D0001H0003 etc...
Be careful, one line in the file means one model, the file does not have empty line.
The script repartitionModel.py can generate a file as describe above.

(4) Example of a color Table :

$ cat MyColorTable.txt

#+BEGION_EXAMPLE
4 0 0 255
1 0 10 56
8 6 7 8
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each line describre a label and it's color (no empty line).The first number is the class number and the three next, the rgb color.

** Training

This part is dedicated to the learning mode.

(1) Explanation about classifMode's options

- separate :
    every pixels are labelled only by one model, the one which learn the region where the pixel is. 

- fusion : 
    every models labelled every pixel. When a decision can not be taken by the fusion function, the label is chosen by the method indicate into the field noLabelManagement.

(2) Explanation about no labels management

- learningPriority :
    the label is chosen by the classification produced by the model which learn the region where the pixel is. 

- maxConfidence :
    the label is chosen by the classification which produce the maximum confidence score. 

** Features

Today, features computed are : NDVI, NDWI and the brightness. Only two sensors are supported, Landsat_8 and Landsat_5, but some others are coming soon. So you only have to fill out the Landsat_8 block composed by many fields.

(1) Explanation about how to store images

    images must be stored by tiles.
    for example : /path/Landsat8_T/X/Y.tif
    - T : a tile name according to Theia definition : D0001H0005 or D0002H0004 ...
    - X : a folder
    - Y : the image
    
    In that example, L8Path : '/path/' and arbo : '/*/*'
    arbo is the path from L8Path, to find the image.tif    

(2) Features available

    NDVI,NDWI,Brightness

Once the configuration file fill out, the chain can be launch.

* How to launch Iota²

you only have to launch the launcher:

cd /path/to/the/python/scripts
. launchChain.sh /path/to/the/configuration/file.cfg

* Products

Each chain creates a tree folder, from the path given in field output, as describe below
